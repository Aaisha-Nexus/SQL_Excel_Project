# 🚀 First SQL + Excel Project of the Year! 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the integration of SQL and Excel for data analysis and visualization. I worked with **MS SQL Server** to set up a database, query data, and analyze sales trends using **Excel** for further data cleaning and visualization. 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **MS SQL Server** for database setup and querying
- **Excel** for data manipulation and visualization
- **PivotTables & Charts** for dynamic reporting
- **SQL Queries** for data extraction and transformation

## 🔍 Key Learnings
### 1️⃣ Setting Up the Database & Querying in MS SQL Server
- Downloaded and loaded data into **MS SQL Server**.
- Transitioned from **PostgreSQL** to **MS SQL Server**, finding core SQL concepts transferable.

### 2️⃣ Querying & Data Manipulation
- Wrote SQL queries based on problem statements.
- Used **CAST() function** for data type formatting.

### 3️⃣ Real-World Mathematical Applications
- Applied **percentage calculations, quarterly analysis, and financial KPIs** to sales data.

### 4️⃣ Excel for Data Cleaning & Analysis
- Used **PivotTables, formulas, and shortcuts** like:
  - `CTRL + H` for bulk value replacement.
  - `=TEXT(..., "dddd")` to extract day names from dates.
  - `COUNTIF(range, criteria)` for counting occurrences.
  - `1/COUNTIF(...)` for simulating distinct counts.
- Discovered workarounds for **PivotTable limitations** (e.g., lack of distinct count function).

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation
- Created **PivotCharts** for insights.
- Faced and resolved **Funnel Chart limitations** by creating a separate data table.
- Used **Slicers** for dynamic report filtering based on months and quarters.
